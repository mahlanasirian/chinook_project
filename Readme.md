# Chinook Database Project

Welcome to the Chinook Database Project! This repository contains various resources related to the Chinook sample database, which is used for learning SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

## Overview of the Chinook Database

The Chinook database is a sample dataset that mimics a digital media store. It includes tables for artists, albums, tracks, customers, invoices, and more, providing a rich context for practicing SQL queries and BI analysis. The dataset is ideal for hands-on learning and exploring data management concepts.

## Database Schema

Here is an overview of the main tables in the Chinook database:

| Table Name       | Description                                             |
